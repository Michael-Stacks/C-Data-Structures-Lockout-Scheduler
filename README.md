Lockout/Tagout Scheduler
A C++ data structures exercise that models and simulates an industrial lockout/tagout procedure to safely isolate machines. Leveraging key containers (unordered_map, vector, unordered_set) and OOP, it reads JSON inputs and produces an optimal, nonâ€‘redundant schedule based on team capabilities.
ðŸš€ Core Data Structures & Algorithms
Fast lookups via unordered_map (O(1) average) for devices & machines

Dynamic arrays (vector) to track related devices & team lists

Sets (unordered_set) to prevent duplicate lockouts

Sorting (std::sort) with custom comparator to define machine order

OOP design: clear class responsibilities, pointer-based associations

ðŸ”§ Features
JSON Parsing: Load realâ€‘world data using nlohmann/json.

Data Structure Mastery:

Map IDs â†’ objects (Device, Machine)

Associate machines â†’ device pointers

Track lockouts efficiently

Scheduling Logic:

Sequential machine processing

Parallelâ€‘capable device assignments (one per team)

Skip alreadyâ€‘locked devices

Detailed Reporting:

List of machines to lock

Stepâ€‘byâ€‘step lockouts by machine

Summary lockouts by team

ðŸ’¡ Customization
Change machine order by editing the lambda in main.cpp.

Tweak JSON in assets/ to test robustness.

Extend with smart pointers or alternative containers (e.g., map, deque).

This project demonstrates advanced use of C++ data structures to solve a realâ€‘world scheduling problem. ðŸ”§ðŸ“ˆ
